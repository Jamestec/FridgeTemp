# FridgeTemp
Wireless and automatic fridge temperature monitoring with an ESP32 and Raspberry Pi. Supports multiple sensors concurrently.

ESP32_FridgeTemp.ino is main code for ESP32. The board I'm using is the Lolin D32 Pro and the sensor is a Si7021 to TMP117. There is usable EPD code for the is Wemos EPD (it sucks since the MISO cable isn't used and could've carried BUSY instead), but I'm currently not using it.
